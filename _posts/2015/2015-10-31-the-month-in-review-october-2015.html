<h2>Notable gems, extensions, and apps</h2>

  <div class="panel-heading"><h3>Foreman <small>gem</small></h3><a href="https://github.com/ddollar/foreman" target="_blank">homepage</a></div>
  <div class="panel-body">
    Running the <strong>rails server, rspec, elasticsearch, mailcatcher, memcached, and fakes3</strong> at the same time can be quite annoying having to open six terminals. Luckily, <strong>foreman</strong> allows you to manage your app's processes in a <code>Procfile</code>. Once in the <code>Procfile</code> you can run everything from one terminal just by running <code>foreman start</code>.

    If you are on Mac OSX a your application requires specific libraries for running in development you can utilize <strong>Brew Bundler</strong> as a way of managing different brew configurations on a per-project basis. Basically identical to how the ruby <code>gemfile</code> works

<h2>Recommended blog posts from exceptional people</h2>
<p><small>(At authors request I will remove their section)</small></p>

<div class="panel panel-default">
  <div class="panel-heading"><h3>Fisher-Yates shuffle algorithm <small>Mike Bostock</small></h3><a href="http://bost.ocks.org/mike/shuffle/" target="_blank">article</a></div>
  <div class="panel-body">
    I have been working on a node.js and socket.io card game in my free time and needed a proper way of shuffling a deck of cards. <strong>Mike Bostock's</strong> post is probably the best example of how to properly shuffle a deck of cards. He details the process from starting from a simple sorting algorithm up to implementing a full Fisher-Yates sorting algorithm. Additionally, he provides excellent interactive examples that show how the sort moves cards around.
