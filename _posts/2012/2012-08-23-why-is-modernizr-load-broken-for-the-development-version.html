<p>The current development version of Modernizr does not contain the yepnope.js bundle.  This is somewhat tricky as there is no error message or notification except in the console debugger.</p><!--excerpt-->

{% highlight js %}
Uncaught TypeError: Object has no method 'load'
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Luckily, there is an easy fix for this.  Just download the <strong>production version</strong> and make sure to mark the checkbox called Modernizr.load(yepnope).  Fixed!</p>
