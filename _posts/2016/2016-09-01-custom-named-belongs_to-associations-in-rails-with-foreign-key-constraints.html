<p itemprop="description">Associations are great in Rails. There is a ton of
functionality baked right in. One such feature is the ability to change the
name of association columns.</p>

  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>First, lets talk through some setup data. We are working with two
models: <strong>Journal</strong> and <strong>User</strong>. And their respective
association:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A User has_many Journals</li>
  <li>A Journal belongs_to a User</li>
</ul>
<p>Given this information you might come up with something like</p>
{% highlight ruby %}
rails generate AddUserToJournal user:references

# app/models/journal.rb
class Journal < ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :user
end

# app/models/user.rb
class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :journals
end

user = User.new(...)
Journal.create(user: user)
{% endhighlight %}

<h2>Who is the creator of the Journal?</h2>
<p>The previous setup works as you would expect, but what if you wanted to better describe
who <em>created</em> a <strong>Journal</strong> without changing the classname for <strong>User</strong>?
You might want a column named <code>creator</code> that stores the user who created the journal.
This would allow for more readable association language for future developers.</p>

<p>Rails has some built in support to achieve just this using some additional arguments
within the belongs_to method. Note: this requires no changes to the User model.</p>
{% highlight ruby %}
# ~Can't use references since we are now aliasing to creator~
rails generate AddCreatorToJournal creator_id:integer

# (2019-03-07) Actually, the above isn't true. You can instead use `creator:references`
# and then fill in the proper configuration within the migration. See the follow-up post
# for more details: http://joshfrankel.me/blog/using-custom-named-association-columns-in-a-rails-migration/

# app/models/journal.rb
class Journal < ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :creator, class_name: :User
end

user = User.new(...)
Journal.create(creator: user) # Check this out! Rails magic allows us to pass in a user as a creator
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Our model now responds to the column name creator the same way it would to a
standard user reference.</p>

<h2>One step further</h2>
<p>You can improve on this approach by adding an index and foreign key to the
creator_id column in the migration. This ensures referential integrity as well as
speeding up any queries based on creator_id.</p>
{% highlight ruby %}
# What the migration might look like
class AddCreatorToJournal < ActiveRecord::Migration
  def change

    # Notice how the index is for :creator but references users
    add_reference :journals, :creator, references: :users, index: true

    # Just like the belongs_to contained class_name: :User, the foreign key
    # also needs a specific custom column name as :creator_id
    add_foreign_key :journals, :users, column: :creator_id
  end
end

# app/models/journal.rb
class Journal < ApplicationRecord
  # Sets the specific name of the foreign key to the creator_id like in the
  # migration above
  belongs_to :creator, class_name: :User, foreign_key: :creator_id
end

# app/models/user.rb
class User < ApplicationRecord
  # We need to speciy what the foreign_key is for the opposite association
  # otherwise the User model won't know what column to join on in the SQL
  # statement.
  has_many :journals, foreign_key: :creator_id
end
{% endhighlight %}
<p>Now you have a custom named column, that is constrained based on a foreign key
, and indexed for faster querying. There are plenty of other tricks with
associations that can also be found on <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/association_basics.html" target="_blank">Rails Guides</a>.</p>
