<p>There are plenty of shortcuts with Ruby on Rail's implementation of migrations. Adding columns, removing column, add indexes, altering table or columns to just name a few. I recently ran across a simple trick that can be utilized to add multiple columns quickly to a migration</p>
<!--excerpt-->
<p>By utilizing the following formula with the Rails generator, you can add multiple columns to a single migration.</p>
{% highlight ruby %}
rails g migration add_first_column_and_second_column_to_model first_column:string second_column:string
{% endhighlight %}
<p>The Rails generate command is smart enough to figure out the correct database table and construct a migration based off it. I imagine this could also be used with other migrations, not just altering an existing table.</p>
<p>Got a Rails generate trick or tip? Tell me about it below in the comments.</p>
