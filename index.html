<p>I am a passionate developer who thrives on the challenge of keeping up with the ever changing web. My experience includes implementing mobile first designs as well as converting existing websites into responsive layouts. I have spent the last four years coding in a variety of languages, completing server and database tasks, and working as part of a results-focused team. I take pride in making sure everything I develop is always up to web standards.</p>
